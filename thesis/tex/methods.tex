\subsection{Popular Features}

The following are a number of features which are commonly used as variables to model bus networks.
Many of the features can be extracted from onboard GPS, or from publically available data sources.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Arrival Time: Time the bus arrives at a stop
  \item Travel Time: The difference in arrival times between two stops
  \item Dwell Time: The amount of time a bus spends at a stop
  \item Schedule Adherence: The difference between the projected arrival time and the actual arrival time
  \item Headway: The difference in arrival time for two adjacent buses at a specific stop
  \item Direction: For a route which runs in both directions
  \item Weather
  \item Traffic Congestion
  \item Day of Week
  \item Month of Year
\end{enumerate}
